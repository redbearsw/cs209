LabFourGame:

In our game, you must navigate Mario to the sun. If he hits an asteroid, you lose 10 points, and if your score goes
below 0 you lose. All controls from LabOneGame work here (rotating, moving with arrow keys, scaling, etc.). There is
music playing continuously during the game. There is a soundeffect for when mario hits an asteroid, and another sound
effect if you lose the game.
